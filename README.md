# IP_Tracker

This app will show you the location of a IP address.
You can input both IP address or URL address.

Just type the IP/URL address to its category input and click on “Find by …” button.
The app will then show you the Country, Region and City this address is coming from.

Remember that the results may be pretty rough and if the other person/server is using something like a VPN service, then it won’t give you the true location.

Build on Python 3.8.
Before running, don’t forget to install all libraries from “requirements.txt.”.
